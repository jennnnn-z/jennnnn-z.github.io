# Jennifer Zhang's Portfolio
Welcome to my website where I showcase my projects and resume. 

## Features
---
### Home Page
This page points users in the direction of my resume or projects or even my photography. 

### Resume Page
This page shows all of the information on my work experience and academics. 

### Projects Page
This page allows users to look at all kinds of projects I have worked on and filter projects by if they were coding projects, ui/ux projects, or other projects. 

### Style
The overall style of the website is designed to delight users with the "early 2000s" look of the front page and the popcat cursor.
